#Tips for designing safe and inclusive events for women and girls

Successful event management for women and girls requires careful strategy and execution. Often times, there are many situational factors at play that are affecting an individual’s comfort, attention, and optimal participation. As a facilitator, it's important to customize such events to their needs, making sure you are encouraging a gender appropriate, inclusive and supportive environment. 

The purpose of this guide is to equip event facilitators with the required know-how to ensure effective and impactful event management for women and girls.

In this guide you will find tips on,

* How to create safe and convenient learning spaces
* Handling controversial topics that might arise
* Understanding personal biases
* Designing for optimal participation

##Creating Safe and Convenient Spaces

Detailed communications leading up to the event is critical. 

Technology can be a useful tool for facilitating such communication. As a facilitator, you can be able to create virtual platforms such as Google groups or Event pages with attendees and share important information. It is pertinent that this information address any safety or convenience converns regarding location, scheduling and logistical factors. Make sure attendees feel like they can easily access the venue and attand a space safely and comfortably. 

Clearly stipulate the purpose of the event and the value to them as participants as it relates to both gender and local context. For example, sending a pre-event email to attendees telling them that "the event is female-only and is meant to be a space where women can share, support and collaborate with each other" will allow participants to come to the event with that mindset. This will ensure that the participants are not only enthusiastic about the subject matter but also comfortable with it. 
 
While at the event, create a comfortable learning and sharing environment by sharing ground rules at the beginning. The point of  ground rules is to create an inclusive space by making sure that individuals feel they can express feelings, opinions and ideas in a way that are welcome and encouraged.

Here are some example ground rules:

* Create a safe place for everyone to share opinions and ideas. 
* Everyone’s opinion is valid and important. There are no bad ideas.
* The information shared by individuals within the session will be held with respect and anonymity.
* The conversation is not meant to discredit any person, organization, group, demographic or gender.
* The conversation is being held with the intent to understand how to make the Internet an open and safe place.
* This is an open environment where we have all come to learn from each other.
* We are here to be accommodative and supportive of each other, not mean, sarcastic or attack each other.
* Say “I” when expressing your opinion so it doesn’t sound like you are speaking for an unknown collective group.
* ……[view this guide to setting ground rules](http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/activities/groundrules.html)

Ask attendees if there are any other norms that might benefit the group? Give attendees information about what or who they can contact during the event if they want to ask questions or address concerns. This might be volunteering yourself, other mentors or directing to external support channels. It is also important to go through an expectation setting with the group to be able to assess what their expectations coming into the event are and to help you know how to structure your content to ensure that you met their concerns. Once you have created a space where individuals feel they can contribute, shift the conversation to why you are there and what you'll learn about that day.

###Activities that create safe spaces

Consider including activities, games or icebreakers that help reinforce a safe/supportive/collaborative space and create a gender-supportive environment.

Some ideas include:

* Run through [this code of conduct exercise](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/code_of_conduct/) that will walk you through some of the considerations associated with anti-harassment policies to put a plan and process in for creating a welcoming, inclusive, harassment-free space. 
* Before running an activity, ask each attendee to share why the topic being covered at the event matters to them (if appropriate, ask them specifically why it matters for females in their location).
* [Run a spectrogram](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/how-to-run-a-spectrogram-icebreaker) and ask questions containing gender-specific language. Ex. “As a women, I feel the Internet is a safe place to use.”
* At the end of the event, have individuals share, either publically or privately, their appreciation for something another women in the room said or did at the event. If opting for more private appreciation, give individuals a few minutes at the end of the event to go up to each other directly (make sure it’s mandatory and don’t be alarmed if it looks like individuals are scrambling everywhere!). 


## Dealing with Controversial Topics

Often when addressing certain issues and concerns related specifically to women and girls, it can be a challenging conversation. Participants may have strong reactions and feelings towards what is being discussed. Facilitators should be aware of the risk and expect certain types of triggers (also known as tension points) to occur. These often occur when dealing with:

* Gender
* Race
* Sexual preference
* Violence (both online and offline)
* Privacy and security
* Culture differences 
 
These triggers can result in individuals:

* Blaming themselves, outsiders or each other
* Frustration over identity including sexual preference, gender, culture etc.
* Becoming embarrassed or uncomfortable and not participating
* Feeling overwhelmed by the reaction of others in the room
* Feeling unsupported or isolated because of comments made
 
Here are some tips to help make sure you are creating a space that is as safe as possible for all individuals when engaging in high-risk conversations:

* Inform attendees beforehand that you will be tackling such sensitive topics so that they have time to digest and reflect on their own
* Reference the agreed upon ground rules when needed
* Encourage the opinions of those who might no longer be sharing, or if more appropriate, ask them why they aren’t participating in a 1-1 setting which they may find more comfortable
* Ask individuals to focus on outcomes and solutions, instead of solely focusing on the problems
* Do regular check-ins with the attendees to see how they feel after a hard conversation. This should be done as a group, although you may choose to do further check-ins with individuals afterwards
* Ensure that you know where to turn should any outside resources be warranted (e.g. support for victims of violence should that be a conversation that might arise)
* Break into smaller groups where individuals might feel more comfortable participating openely.



## Understanding Unconscious Biases

What is unconscious bias?

* Your mind makes 50,000 “fast” associations per one “slow” association
* It bases these on information it has been passively collecting your whole life
* The unconscious mind is powerful and may surprise you
* We do not control unconscious bias but we do control conscious action, so this is an opportunity to get rid of guilt and blame but take responsibility for change.

We often don't realize we make biased decisions. Strongly held engrained notions about male and female norms and roles can result in personal biases and reflect upon your choice of wording, actions and presence as a facilitator. This may result, as an example, in an inclination to give greater attention to men over women in conversations on technical topics, or referring to professionals as “he” and those taking nurturing roles as “she”, etc. It is important to understand how this can affect the dynamics in a group.

## Designing for Participation

It’s important that in events, facilitation and material are created or adapted for events with women and girls. Here’s a checklist to review before your event:

* Is the curriculum, resources and media being used aware of gender sensitivity and inclusion?
* Are the exercises and learning hands-on, interactive and allow individuals to work in groups?
* Have we predetermined working groups that mix up the crowd and ensure a variety of personalities?
* Is the curriculum, resources and material sensitive to certain external factors that are most common with women, such as social norms and barriers to opportunities, abuse, cyber violence, child safety, privacy, etc. and do they address priority areas of interest to women and girls, whatever they may be?
* Are sensitive topics being covered, and if so, am I aware of the triggers that might occur and how to handle them?
* Are there opportunities to talk in small groups where individuals may be more comfortable sharing their opinion?
* Are there opportunities for participants to be assigned roles such as moderator, time-keeper, note-taker, etc.?
* Are there safe places you can point attendees to after the event to continue sharing, talking and reflecting with others?
 
Remember to be:

* Open to real conversations where individuals can be vulnerable and open
* Honest to each other
* Respectful of different ideas and backgrounds
* Understanding of different perspectives
* Preview material ahead of time to ensure that it is appropriate for workshop participants 
* Encouraging of good behaviour or when individuals participate in ways that might be out of the norm for themselves
