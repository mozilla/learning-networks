#Marketing Your Mozilla Club: A PR Guide

##Your Mission
Encourage local newspapers, radio stations and other media to share the story of your Mozilla Clubs with your community.

##Your Qualifications
You are a leader within a local Mozilla Club community with an interest in identifying, talking to and working with local media to share the story of your Club.

##Your Tasks
1. Start by writing a [blog post](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/marketing-your-mozilla-club-writing-a-blog/) about your Mozilla Club and how it’s making a difference in your community. 
2. Turn your blog post into a pitch — a shorter version for sending to reporters. Include a “hook,” or the reason reporters should write about it: are you doing something unexpected? Is someone notable attending? Is there a tie-in to a current breaking news story or trend? Is part of a larger campaign that Mozilla or others are participating in?
3. Also include important information about your Mozilla Club: its mission, members, location and curriculum. Make sure it includes all the key details of who, what, where, when and how. As well as why you are running a Mozilla Club, what is the importance and how you are creating an impact within your community. 
4. Build a list of local media contacts; reporters and writers who regularly cover topics like technology, education, nonprofits and open source. Consider local newspapers, TV and radio stations, magazines and blogs. You can generally find a reporter’s email address on their paper’s website, or on their professional Twitter account. If not, try calling the outlet and ask to leave a voicemail for the reporter. Networking is also a great way to meet and build relationships with reporters and other influential leaders in the community that can help spread the word about your Club. Try attending community events, relevant meetups, and other community organized events to meet new people. 
5. Share your pitch with media. Give them a quick line at the top of your message or on the phone as to why they should care or cover the topic. Email and phone work best. Social media works, too. Be polite. And nice. Journalists are overworked and busy. No one likes to get a rude or presumptuous email. Always paste everything into the body of an email. NEVER send an attachment. Ever. (They won’t open it.)  And if it’s event related, make sure to give at least three-weeks notice. 
6. When a reporter is interested, provide them with additional, accurate information about your Club or Mozilla. If you need help, contact a member of the Mozilla Clubs team for support. Ask when the story will be published, and keep an eye out for it. If you don’t hear back back from a reporter, follow up once more within one to two weeks. If you don’t hear back the second time, the reporter is likely unable to attend. 
7. Share your results with Mozilla. Email a link to the news story to kevin@mozillafoundation.org and share on Twitter using #teachtheweb. If no press are able to attend your event, don’t worry — getting media coverage is hard! Instead, feel free to take photos, write a [blog post](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/marketing-your-mozilla-club-writing-a-blog/), and share those with the world. On Twitter, tag [@MozLearn](https://twitter.com/MozLearn) so that we can see what your Club is doing!
