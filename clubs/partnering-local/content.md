Mozilla Clubs provide many benefits to a local community by teaching individuals valuable digital skills like reading, writing, and participating on the web. One way to provide even further benefit to the community is to partner with local businesses and organizations, strengthening their identity and drawing more attention from the community. In turn, the partnership can enhance a Mozilla Club experience by expanding reach and access to potential resources or tools available to the Club. 

In this guide, you’ll find:

* Recommendations and benefits to approaching student organizations, local businesses, and informal learning spaces
* Best practices for the initial contact, following up, and building long-term relationships

##Partnering with Student Organizations

University students and staff can be a very powerful addition to your Club, while the students and university will also discover many benefits from a partnership:

* IT/CS department students can use Clubs as an opportunity to improve their teaching skills and practice their learning. The presence of IT/CS students also serves as inspiration for learners as they engage with each others. People with CS/IT background will improve their facilitation skills and their ability to explain technical concepts in easy terms which is also great for their future professional life.
* Students of pedagogy, sociology or education background can do field work inside your Club and help your team refine their facilitation and collaboration skills. They can help identify where your methods need improvement and how to adapt activities to your local context. Clubs are very fertile ground for pedagogy and sociology students.

Best Practices for approaching a university, college, or high school: 

* Speak directly with the head of the department.
* Before talking to the department, gain support of one or more teachers in that same department.
* A structured presentation detailing “why Mozilla clubs”, “why Mozilla”, “why this department”, “how the students/teachers/staff will benefit” is a must. 
* Present a real project with which your Mozilla Club and the institution can collaborate, outlining the benefits and opportunities will make it much easier to establish a formal partnership.
  * Example: Helping or doing field work inside a club can be a project for a given class. A supportive teacher can lead this project inside the university. 
  * Example: Students can complete special assignments for a class using your Club as the subject.

##Partnering with local businesses
Local businesses have high partnership potential because the benefit can be strong to both their business and your Club. For the local business, donating goods, services, or meeting space to your Club in return for free marketing and publicity is an excellent value. 

For example:
_It is common for Clubs to use office supplies, such as markers, sticky notes, and flipcharts during activities. The costs of these materials add up as events become more popular and more frequent. Establishing a partnership with a local office supplier can be mutually beneficial for the club (donated or discounted materials) and the business (exposure of their products and possibly marketing)._

Here is a real-life Case Study example: 
_[Rio Mozilla Club](http://riomozillaclub.org/) has a partnership with a popular local stationary shop. The owner of this shop is engaged in social activism and very keen to help projects that can have social impact. Thanks to their support, the Club has 20% discount on supplies at the shop which is a tremendous savings with 8+ events per month._ 

The same approach can be used with delis, restaurants and other places to get snacks for Club members!

##Partnering with informal learning spaces

Informal learning spaces, such as libraries, parks, maker spaces, museums, hacker spaces, fab labs, and LAN houses are often open to renting space to community programs and clubs.

These venues are usually easy to approach and usually a simple inquiry with the manager can get your Club on their schedule.

##Best Practices for Making the Initial Contact 
You may be nervous about approaching a potential Club partner. Here are a few common concerns that you may be considering, and best practices for overcoming them:

**Concern #1: I dislike speaking to strangers, especially if it is in front of a group of people. How can I overcome this?**
[Consult the Mozilla Club guide on public speaking](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/public-speaking/). It has tips, tricks, and best practices to help you become comfortable with public speaking. 

**Concern #2: What if I say the wrong thing?**
We are here to help you prepare so that can meet your potential partner with confidence. Feel free to use and remix these resources:

* Represent Mozilla Clubs well with this [PowerPoint deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18TvYogZefxmybDmAPxXVyqj9r4NEoH7ngS3V5hwuYBE/edit#slide=id.g1191d7057f_0_6) with vivid imagery and clear explanations of the program. Add your specific requests and partnership benefits to enhance your presentation.
* While you don’t want to sound like your a reading from a script, having a good idea of what you are going to say, whether on the phone, in an email, or even if you meet someone in person just by chance. [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-5_JYZGM-NJzbs2nl5DS0P_FAb3nxt-fiPAbOT5WRY/edit?usp=sharing) will provide you with a sample email, phone script, and “elevator speech” to help formulate your thoughts. Feel free to remix to your needs!
* Brush up on your public speaking skills (or build up or confidence) with this [Mozilla Club Guide on Public Speaking](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/public-speaking/).

**Concern #3: What if they say no?** 
Understand that not every potential partner is a good fit for your Club. If they say no, it likely wouldn’t have been a successful relationship anyway. Hold your head up high and move to the next potential partner on your list.

The most important thing for you to do when approaching a potential partner is to be prepared and confident. These two resources for making a great first impression can help:

##Following Up
Follow up to help your name and Club stand out among the recipient’s busy schedule and to do list. You want to show that you are serious about pursuing a partnership, and following up provides another opportunity for your professionalism to shine.

**How and when to follow up**

* After initial contact via email or voice message, if you do not receive a response after one week, send a follow up email or voice message. 
  * If you originally sent an email, calling by phone and vice versa. Just keep your follow up brief and to the point. 
  * Keep your same message from the original contact, but condense it into a friendly reminder.
  * [This website](http://www.hubspot.com/sales/follow-up-email) has follow up email pointers, as well as a few versions of a follow up email template. 
* If after your follow up contact you still receive no response after another week (two weeks from original contact), choose either phone or email and try one last time to make contact. 
  * Do not sound annoyed. Be humble and gracious for any opportunity that may arise. You definitely won’t get a response if you sound rude and demanding of their time.
  * Keep this final contact even more brief than the first follow up. They likely received your message and are busy or not interested. There is no need to rehash the details of your request.
  * If you receive no response after this attempt, assume the answer is “no” and move to the next partnership opportunity. 
* After an initial meeting or presentation, send a follow-up thank you email or hand-written note within one day. Keep it professional, concise, and humble.

##Building long-term partnerships
From the very beginning, you should approach potential partners like they can be your Club’s new best friend. While the specifics are dependent on your Club and the partner you are pursuing, the benefits of a long-term relationship versus a one-time deal make a long list for both of you. Ongoing support (professional or monetary), community representation and visibility, strong advocates for “the cause” (whatever that is in your community), are just a few.
Many benefits you may not realize/understand until the relationship has matured!

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/thesba/2013/04/25/tips-for-building-long-term-client-relationships/#7c074ca544d0) offers a great list of ways to foster ongoing and healthy long-term partnerships. We’ve condensed it and written a few helpful notes just for you:

* There is no such thing as over-communicating, so communicate to your new partner more often than you think is necessary! They will let you know if it is too much.
* Be a useful resource to your partner. Don’t just “take” from them, give back.
* Be honest AT ALL TIMES.
* Meet your deadlines or any commitment you have made to them. You will expect them to do the same.
* Eliminate surprises by being as clear as possible and communicate, communicate, communicate!
* Think of your new partner as more than just a partner. Get to know the person behind the partnership. Learn their likes, dislikes, preferences for communication, favorite lunch spot, etc.
* Reward your loyal partners! Don’t forget about them once you have moved on to securing another partner. Treat them well and always be gracious for their continued support.
* Have a vision for the partnership. Shape it together and connect frequently to see if there are new opportunities that you can both approach together.
