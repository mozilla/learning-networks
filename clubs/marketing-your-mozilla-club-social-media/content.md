#Marketing Your Mozilla Club: Social Media Guide

##Your Mission
Share your Mozilla Club experiences on Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms


##Your Qualifications
Adept at creating social content, promoting an event or group, and reaching the right audience

##Your Tasks
1. Pick your social network(s). You know your community best and where you are most likely to engage the most people, promote your club and have meaningful conversations. For example, Facebook is typically better for promoting events, Twitter is great for having one-to-one conversations and Instagram is great for telling your Club’s story visually. 

2. Share frequent social media updates that encourage people to learn more about your Mozilla Club, or Mozilla Clubs in general, promote events, or engage in specific Clubs activities.

3. Always include a Call to Action (CTA) in your post that encourages people to do more. This is usually a link to a blog post or web page that allows people to sign up for a Club nearby.

4. When on Twitter, use #teachtheweb and /or #MozillaClubs to share with the community and tag @MozTeach and/or @Mozilla in your tweets to invite participation in the conversation. 

5. Nothing beats taking the time to connect with followers on your channels to support their efforts to explore a challenging new learning environment. You can view, comment on, share, and Retweet (RT) great content, invite followers to your events and answer questions.

6. Help us identify additional social network platforms (WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram, etc.) in your region that we should be using to spread the word about Mozilla Clubs. Once you identify them, let us know!

##Your Goals
* Post Mozilla Club content regularly (about three times/week) 
* Interact with (like, favorite, Retweet, share) other people’s social media content about Mozilla Clubs
* Provide timely responses to followers’ questions and comments. However, use your best judgement and don’t engage the trolls (“fake” profiles)! 
* Remind people to follow you or visit your blog for future updates

##Social Media Do’s and Dont’s
* Do add a picture whenever you can. Make sure it’s relevant and properly cropped
* Do keep your posts short and to the point. Generally, the less text, the better a post performs
* Do respond to comments in a helpful and timely fashion. If you don’t have the answer, help the user find a Mozillian who does
* Don’t engage with spammers, trolls, or users who are not being civil. Instead, ignore them
* Don’t create a new social media profile for your Club unless you are able to update it and respond to questions regularly. A dormant profile can confuse and frustrate people  
* Don’t write overly long statuses and updates — save those for blog posts
