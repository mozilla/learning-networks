Developed by: Shreyas Kutty, Carolina Tejada Alvarez, Kristina Gorr and the Mozilla Clubs team

How does "teach like Mozilla" translate to your Mozilla Club? Instead of conventional learning methods that include watching & listening, explore participatory, inclusive and fun ways of teaching.  Below are facilitation tips, activity ideas and resources to help you get started!

###First, what do we mean by “participatory” and “playful”?
**Participatory** = Participation = Your club members actively engaged in discussion, activities, and relationships with other Club members.

**Playful** = Engaged & Fun = Your club members don’t feel that they are in a classroom or learning. They are having such a great time and engrossed in the activities and environment that it’s more like “play” than “classroom”.

##Facilitation Tips
Facilitating discussion and activities should be more about guiding participants through their own learning, as opposed to “telling” how to learn. Here are great tips to help facilitate the best and most effective discussions in your Mozilla Club!

* Keep the core of Mozilla Clubs in mind: Your club should be a small community that meets regularly in person to learn how to read, write and participate on the Web in an inclusive, engaging way.
* Play a cheerleader role, not a micromanagement role. Share, learn, motivate, create together. [Connect with other Mozilla Club Captains](https://discourse.webmaker.org/c/mozilla-clubs) and share ideas.
    * Here are a couple of examples of what you may learn. More experiences can be [found here](https://dunebuggie.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/mozfestplayful-participatory-learning-at-mozilla-clubs/).
        * In India, some Clubs taught code through games like hopscotch and HTML web page frameworks using bricks, using Lo-Fi and No-Fi teaching kits. 
        * In Brazil, people are taught to remix web pages of a popular gaming website.
* Create projects with your students from inception, instead of on your own. This encourages participation in every aspect of your Mozilla Club!
* Have individuals work in teams to complete activities and collaborate on work. 
* Encourage participants to help others if they finish the activity early. This encourages teamwork!
* Use common, everyday props to help illustrate teaching points. It helps the idea to stick.
Keep participants on their feet or moving throughout the event. This will help the energy and attention high. 
* If you know that a part of your meeting agenda includes a more low-energy activity, be sure to balance out your meeting with at least one high energy, offline, and playful activity!
* Pay attention to your meeting space. Research shows the lighting, smell, temperature, etc. can affect people’s ability to learn and collaborate.
    * Change your meeting location from time to time to provide a refreshing atmosphere (park, rail station, etc.). OR take advantage of your space by doing different activities in various parts of the space (i.e. do an activity outside).
