#Clubs Communications: Blogging Guide

##Your Mission
Write regular blog articles about your Mozilla Club to tell its story / discuss recent Club events and activities; encourage participation within your community.

##Your Qualifications
Have a compelling story to share and experience publishing online via blogs or other mediums. Be comfortable sharing your blog on social media, email and other avenues.

##Your Tasks
1. Write regular blog posts on your personal or club web page about your Mozilla Club. Range from 250-500 words.
2. Include important information about your Club: examples of moments when your Club taught and learned the Web; where the club is based, what skills you taught at an event, how many members there are, how often you meet and what activities and products you use. (If this isn’t your first time blogging about your Club, consider writing about a recent Club event or activity.) 
3. Tell your story: tell your reader why Web Literacy is important to you — and them. This should be in narrative form. Briefly describe the Club or your experience so readers understand the context. 
4. Include photos/videos or links to relevant content. Provide links to the activities and web pages your Club uses.
5. Use correct spelling, grammar and punctuation (protip: ask someone to help proofread your work before submitting).
6. Share your results with Mozilla. Email a link to your blog to amira@mozillafoundation.org or use [#teachtheweb](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23teachtheweb) on Twitter.

##Your Goals
* Post at least one blog about your Mozilla Club in the next month
* Share your blog with others who might be interested in participating. You can do this through [social media](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIukayevaotjBNtn_sRO3ozPPvlrghFs6mGbHjhTCs0/edit). On Twitter, include [@MozTeach](https://twitter.com/mozteach), #teachtheweb, or #MozillaClubs in your posts so we can keep up-to-date with your Clubs happenings.
* Encourage learners in your club to submit their own blogs or written submissions to share. 
* Provide timely responses to any commenters’ questions

##Getting Started
* What did you experience that you want to share?
* Choose one topic/theme/opinion to discuss.
* What was interesting?
* Was there something that inspired you?
* How does what you experience connect to your interests? Or other activities you are involved in?
* Did a previously held opinion or perception change? How?
* Did you learn something? What was it?

##Examples
* [Blog](http://riomozillaclub.org/) by Mozilla Club Rio
* Atique, a Mozillian in Bangladesh, wrote [a blog](http://atiqueahmedziad.github.io/2015/Webmaker-app-for-android-ndc/) about his experience hosting a Mozilla Webmaker event. His blog is descriptive and has lots of photos — a good format to follow.
