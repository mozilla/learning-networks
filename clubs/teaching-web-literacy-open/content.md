#Teaching Web Literacy in the Open
Developed by: Simeon Oriko, Carolina Tejada Alvarez, Kristina Gorr and the Mozilla Clubs team

How do organizations work in the open and how can your Mozilla Club replicate those ideas? By reviewing case studies of organizations working in the open, teaching how to practice open, and having hands on tutorials using web tools that facilitate working in the open, we’ll learn the answer. Less what to do and more how to do it!

##What does “teaching in the open” mean?

Teaching = to impart knowledge of skill

Open = unobstructed entrance and exit; not shut or closed

Therefore, to teach in the open is to impart a knowledge or skill (web literacy, in our case) in an unobstructed environment, with no closed entrance or exit for collaborators. All knowledge, skill, processes, and goals are completely transparent to those in our community. 

##Facilitation Tips
Teaching web literacy in the open will require that you model working in the open while facilitating your Mozilla Club. Here are some tips for effectively doing so:
* Build and plan your Mozilla Clubs meeting agenda using collaborative tools and welcome feedback or ideas from all members
    * Example of collaborative tools: [Github](https://github.com/), [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/)
* Create projects with your students from inception, instead of on your own. This encourages collaboration in every aspect of your Mozilla Club!
* Play a cheerleader role, not a micromanagement role. Share, learn, motivate, create together. Connect with other Mozilla Club Captains and share ideas.
* Build confidence in participants by creating a safe environment where there are no “stupid” questions, every mistake is viewed as an opportunity to learn, and work as a team.
* Be sure to share everything! From assumptions to work done to future goals. 
* Tell attendees what you intend to do with the work and discussions being held at any time. Be transparent with why you are doing the things you do. 
* Research and implement best practices from other programs that work in the open.

##Activity Ideas
Here are a list of suggested activities to help your Mozilla Club participants understand why and how teaching the web in the open is important and to begin thinking of implementation. 
* Personal Presentation Icebreakers: Example: Invite the participants to draw a self picture and paste it on the wall to create a class photo. This builds a sense of belonging and community and also provides a point of reflection.
* Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions: Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then stick it to a wall.
    * Here is an idea of a few prompts/activities to create one session:
        * What does “teaching in the Open” mean to you in terms of culture and values?
        * Map out the terms that are used to describe both open tools and open culture. This “answer key” can help you to facilitate:
            * Tools: Github, Etherpad, Thimble, Libreoffice, Badges
            * Culture: Transparency, Collaboration, Sharing, Free, Diversity, 
        * Ask participants to reflect on how these values and tools are interrelated and then ask them to connect them (use arrows, string, whatever you have available)
        * Ask participants to think about and discuss the strategies and processes that allows the tools and values to work in a meaningful way.
* Thimble remix activities: remixing and sharing projects is a great way to encourage open collaboration and discussion...and participants will learn while they are doing it!
    * Remix [3 Things I <3](https://thimble.mozilla.org/anonymous/3578f294-39ed-475a-ab2e-a401f30ec9c6/2375) project to ask participants 3 things they want to learn from your Mozilla Club
    * Remix [My Six-Word Summer](https://thimble.mozilla.org/anonymous/2ef1be99-93fc-49e0-8567-cfa5d4717bb5/2500) project to ask participants their ideas for upcoming meetings
    * This detailed kit for the [Writing Excuse Generator](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/14616/writing-excuse-generator.html) promotes teaching in the open in an engaging, holistic way.
* Teaching Activities: These are great team building activities that encourages working together and community sharing.
    * [Why Do We Use The Web?](https://chadsansing.github.io/curriculum-testing/web-lit-basics-two/session01-why-do-we-use-the-web.html): Learners will create and research survey questions about their community's Web use, learning collaborating, community participation, and open practices.
    * [Web Chef](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session03-chef.html): Learners will teach their peers a skill and document the steps by making a web resource that includes properly attributed open content. 
    * [Story of Us](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session03-storyofus.html): Learners will learn how to tell their Story of Self, use it to reflect on what they have learned, the role of learning socially, and how they want to learn and participate on the web and with their community going forward. And using and sharing files in open, web-friendly formats when appropriate.
    * [Para Para Animation](https://karenlouisesmith.makes.org/thimble/para-para-animation-teaching-kit): This tool allows individuals to create short, multi-frame animations that will play against the backdrop of a collaborative wall.
